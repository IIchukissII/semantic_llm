The young boy, despite his family's pressing needs, felt a strange, unshakable sense of purpose coursing through him. That very evening, he would host an extravagant feast, using his efficiency to create a delicious spread from the meager provisions.

As he sat down before an antique glass desk, the dim light reflecting off the polished surface, he gazed intently at the screen, the contentment on his face replaced by a sudden, inexplicable dread - as if the relentless ticking of time had begun to squeeze the very life out of him.

A panicked glance from one such character may instill unease, yet it is rarely followed by action that would truly better the situation. The news they bring, as if on cue, is seldom good - a score that would make even the most ardent optimist question the worth of hope. They seem to be perpetually at odds with themselves and others, lacking the form or substance to truly shine. Indeed, their presence often leaves one with a feeling of disquietude, as though they are an unwelcome enemy in our otherwise peaceful society.
