I've built this whole elaborate mystery around myself, complete with clues and red herrings, because the alternative - that I'm just fundamentally broken or worse, completely ordinary - is too pathetic to face. *looks directly at therapist for the first time* What if I spend years digging and there's just... nothing there worth finding?",
