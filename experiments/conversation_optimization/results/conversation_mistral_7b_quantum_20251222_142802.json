In the course of these inquiries, sake is unveiled as the contents hidden within the dishrag. Once again, the package reveals more than initially perceived - it seems to represent a symbol of gluttony.",

However, this newfound trait leads him down a dangerous path. He loses control over his own volition, no longer choosing what to eat but being controlled by his desires. In this state, he reaches a point where he becomes a forerunner, setting an example of unbridled gluttony for others to follow.",

In the final stretch, the desired outcome is found again - but only to be followed by an unexpected turn, as life suddenly flatlines. In this moment of pause, there is a sense of aggrandizement, perhaps recognition of the journey completed.",
