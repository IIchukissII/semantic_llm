It felt ancient, like it knew secrets about me \nI didn't know myself. It started walking into the forest and I followed it. \nWe came to a river - it was the same river from my childhood. Under the water I could see \nsleeping bears. I was scared but the deer nudged me toward the water. One bear woke up \nand came toward me. I was terrified but it just touched my hand with its nose, gently.\nI woke up feeling like something important happened.",

      "therapist": "It sounds like this dream had a profound impact on you, leaving you with a sense of something important happening. I'm struck by the contrast between the fear and terror you felt, and the gentle touch of the bear's nose on your hand. Can you tell me more about what you felt in that moment when the bear touched your hand - was it a sense of calm, or perhaps a feeling of being seen or understood in some way?",
