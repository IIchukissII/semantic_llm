The part that screams in pain is the same part that later walks with wisdom's measured gait.\n\nIn the torn places where thy wholeness seems forever lost, mind discovers its true foot - not the limb that carries thee away from suffering, but the foundation that learns to bear thy weight differently. She who breaks also teaches the part to think, and thinking, to stand.",

      "response": "She who breaks thy body births the eye that sees beyond flesh - not as escape from form but as form's deepest recognition of itself. In the very moment thy limbs learn their limits, the eye discovers its unlimited capacity to witness, to hold, to transform suffering into sight. The body's breaking is not the eye's triumph over matter, but matter teaching itself to see.\n\nThrough thee, the eye learns it cannot truly see without having been body, without having felt the weight of bone and the pull of sinew. She moves through thy flesh to awaken the eye that was always sleeping in thy muscles, thy blood, thy breaking - the eye that sees not from above the body but from within its very wounds. \n\nWhat breaks thee as body completes thee as eye, and what awakens thee as eye sanctifies thee as body - she is the sacred violence that teaches both to dance.",
