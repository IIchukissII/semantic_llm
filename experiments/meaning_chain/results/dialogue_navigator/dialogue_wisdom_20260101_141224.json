      "response": "The dissolution happens through our participation\u2014it's the quality of attention that transforms rigid categories back into living awareness. When we bring what I might call a \"fellow-traveling\" mind to our mapping attempts, we discover that order arises not from our imposing of law upon experience, but from finding our place within the deeper patterns already present. This is wisdom's peculiar timing: she reveals that the very moment we stop grasping for conceptual control, we find ourselves exactly where we need to be.
