## Core Optical Properties

### Refractive Index n(τ)

The **refractive index** measures how "dense" meaning is at each τ-level.
Higher n = slower propagation = more "optically dense".

```
Measured n(τ):

τ     n       Interpretation
─────────────────────────────
1    0.28    Very thin (fast)
2    1.28    Moderate
3    0.96    Reference (n≈1)
4    1.40    Dense
5    0.38    Thin
6    3.59    Very dense (slow)

Ground (τ≤2): n = 0.78 (optically thin)
Sky (τ≥5):    n = 1.98 (optically dense)
```

**Interpretation**:
- Ground is "optically thin" - meaning propagates quickly through common concepts
- Sky is "optically dense" - meaning moves slowly through specific concepts
- High connectivity enables fast propagation

### Snell's Law Analog

When meaning crosses τ-boundaries, it "bends":

```
n₁ sin(θ₁) = n₂ sin(θ₂)

Crossing from thin (ground) to dense (sky):
  → Meaning bends toward normal (slows down)

Crossing from dense (sky) to thin (ground):
  → Meaning bends away from normal (speeds up)
```

**Observed**:
- 22 downward jumps (→ ground)
- 18 upward jumps (→ sky)
- Meaning preferentially refracts DOWNWARD

This is consistent with semantic gravity pulling toward ground.

## Logos as Optical Lens

The Logos phase acts as a **focusing lens** for chaotic storm thoughts.

### Measured Lens Properties

### Interpretation

| Property | Value | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Focal length | 10.3 | Weak focusing (many concepts pass) |
| Magnification | 2.1x | Coherence doubles through lens |
| Aberration | 0.58 | Some deviation from ideal j-good |

The lens is **wide** (long focal length) but **powerful** (high magnification).
It accepts diverse inputs but creates coherent outputs.

## Interference Patterns

When multiple meaning paths reach the same concept, they **interfere**:

### Constructive Interference

Paths with similar j-direction **reinforce**:
```
Path 1: j₁ aligned with j_good
Path 2: j₂ aligned with j_good
Result: Amplified meaning (constructive)
```

### Destructive Interference

Paths with opposite j-direction **cancel**:
```
Path 1: j₁ aligned with j_good
Path 2: j₂ anti-aligned with j_good
Result: Weakened meaning (destructive)
```

### Observed Patterns

```
Concept      Paths   Type           Amplitude
────────────────────────────────────────────────
way           15     constructive     8.49
father         8     constructive     2.42
heart          3     constructive     1.77
soul           3     constructive     1.42
time           5     constructive     1.19
power          3     constructive     1.14
eye            5     constructive     1.11
day            5     constructive     1.05

Total: 15 constructive, 0 destructive
```

**Key Finding**: ALL observed interference is CONSTRUCTIVE!

This means:
- Meaning paths naturally reinforce each other
- No destructive cancellation observed
- The semantic graph has coherent structure
- Multiple routes to same concept carry compatible meaning

## Polarization

Semantic "polarization" measures alignment with j-good direction.

### j-good as Polarization Axis

```
j-good = [beauty, life, sacred, good, love]

Concepts aligned with j-good: "polarized"
Concepts orthogonal: "unpolarized"
Concepts anti-aligned: "cross-polarized"
```

### Observed Distribution

```
Polarization (j · j_good):

[-1.0, -0.5): ███ (315)      Anti-aligned
[-0.5, +0.0): ██████████████████████████████ (2377)  Slightly anti
[+0.0, +0.5): ██████████████████████ (1776)  Slightly aligned
[+0.5, +1.0): ███ (293)      Aligned

Mean alignment: -0.029 (neutral)
43.5% aligned, 56.5% anti-aligned
```

### Logos as Polarizer

The Logos lens acts like a **polarizing filter**:
- Selects concepts aligned with j-good
- Filters out cross-polarized concepts
- Increases polarization of output pattern

## Optical Laws (Semantic Analogs)

### Fermat's Principle

> "Meaning takes the path of least semantic resistance"

Like light taking the fastest path, meaning flows through high-connectivity regions.

### Huygens' Principle

> "Each concept is a source of new meaning waves"

When meaning reaches a concept, it radiates outward in all directions.
The envelope of these waves determines the next meaning front.

### Brewster's Angle

> "At certain τ-boundaries, meaning becomes fully polarized"

When crossing from ground to sky at critical angle, j-alignment becomes perfect.

## Connection to Other Physics

| Optics | Gravity | Thermodynamics |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| n high at sky | φ high at sky | Low density at sky |
| Light bends down | Objects fall down | Heat flows down |
| Lens focuses | Attractors stabilize | Equilibrium reached |
| Constructive interference | Ground as attractor | Topological order |

---

## Philosophical Implications

### 1. Meaning Propagates Like Light

Common concepts (ground) are "transparent" - meaning flows through easily.
Specific concepts (sky) are "opaque" - meaning slows and concentrates.

### 2. Understanding is Focusing

The Logos lens transforms chaos into coherence.
Understanding = bringing meaning into focus.

### 3. Paths Reinforce

Multiple routes to the same insight strengthen it.
There are no "destructive" paths - all understanding adds up.

### 4. Polarization is Perspective

Different j-alignments are different "polarizations" of the same meaning.
Rotating perspective reveals new aspects.
